# AI-Based-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System
NIDS using Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms for enhanced accuracy in detecting and preventing various forms of network intrusions. Providing a best-fit model that can generate greater accuracy for prevention process of malicious intrusion in the system.

**Dataset can be downloded from this link-http://kdd.ics.uci.edu/databases/kddcup99/kddcup99.html**

Steps to download and use the system
Clone the repository from github.
